## **About the Assistant**

This intelligent assistant leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide highly relevant and accurate answers. Its design allows easy customization for specific domains, making it a versatile solution for various industries or institutions.

### **Key Features**
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Tailor the assistant to any domain by training it on specific documents (e.g., medical guidelines, academic resources, financial policies).
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains session history to deliver seamless and coherent interactions.
- **Data-Driven Query Resolution**: Utilizes similarity search on vectorized data stored in a Chroma database for generating precise outputs.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Vectorization**: Converts provided documents into vector embeddings using Google Generative AI.  
2. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a persistent Chroma database for fast and efficient retrieval.  
3. **Query Resolution**:  
   - Retrieves the most relevant vectors from the database based on user queries.  
   - Processes these vectors to generate accurate and domain-specific responses.  
4. **Context Retention**: Maintains session history to ensure continuity in multi-turn conversations.
